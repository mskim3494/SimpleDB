# Introduction to Databases 23500 / 33550
This is the main repository for Intro to DB. Homework assignments, project files, and extra class materials will come to this repository in a branch (e.g. "hw3" or "lab2").
Your homework and project submissions will be made here, committed in a specified branch, pushed to your remote repository on GitLab, and then submitted via [Chisubmit](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chisubmit/).
If you are not familiar with Git, I strongly suggest you take 15 minutes and visit [TryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). 

 - The hws directory is for smaller homeworks, with each homework as a subdirectory. 
 - The simpledb directory is a course long project for people enrolled in 23500 that is a pedagogical database written in Java. Note that some documentation may refer to labs,
these are not labs in CSIL, but a legacy term. You can think of them as milestones with due dates.
 - The coldb directory is a course project for people enrolled in 33550. Here you will write a column-oriented main-memory database in C, nearly from scratch. This project will have milestones, but
the main deliverable will be do at the end of the quarter. There will be little supervision on this project and requires students to be proactive.
 - The materials directory is more any miscellaneous course materials that cannot be distributed via Piazza.
